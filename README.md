Welcome to this project,a silly or boring project !

Advanced comment:
  Maybe you will think it is such a silly or boring  project ,I'will keep improving it and try my best ,although I'm just a senior student.
  This project is base on C++ 17 and easyx 5.

What's the project?
	This project mainly used to creat a dynamic effect which is surrouned by some pictures which you selected。
  It's only a frame with px:900*900 and the picture you selected must be px300*300
  The rotate speed can be chosen by yourself in the variable：speech.
  
How can I start the project:
  Step1:install Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or higher verison
  Step2:download easyx and install it 
  Step3:open sln file
  Also you could replace the picture ♂ in the file named resource,but remember remain the px 300*300.
  
If you appreciate the project,you could communicate with me by e-mail 2367347407@qq.com
