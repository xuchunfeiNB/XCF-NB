Welcome to this project,a silly or boring project !

Prior Announcements:
  	Probably you will think that the project is silly and boring ,well ,I'm just a programming beginer.
        I'will keep improving it and try my best ,although I'm just a senior school student.
 	This project is base on C++ and easyx.

What's the project?
	This project is mainly used to creat a dynamic effect ，you will see many pictures rotate around the center.
  	It's only a frame with px:900*900 and the picture you selected must be px300*300 and no more than 8.
  	The rotate speed can be chosen by yourself in the variable："speech".
  
How can I start the project:
  	Step1:Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or higher verison
  	Step2:Download Easyx and install it 
  	Step3:open sln file
  	Also you could replace the picture in the file named resource,but remember remain the px 300*300,as well as the back image and back music.It depends on yourself.
  
If you appreciate the project,you could communicate with me by e-mail 2367347407@qq.com
